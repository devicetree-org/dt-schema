      Occasionally PCI devices have interrupts which are not PCI interrupts. In
      these cases, use "interrupts-extended" so it is not ambiguous.

      The minimum amount of time that each component must wait in
      L1.2.Exit after sampling CLKREQ# asserted before actively driving
      the interface to ensure no device is ever actively driving into an
      unpowered component. This value is based on the components and AC
      coupling capacitors used in the connection linking the two
      components (PCIe r7.0, sec 5.5.4).
