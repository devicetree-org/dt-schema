    title: PCI Express Downstream port

    description: |
      This node represents PCI Express port in Downstream direction of some PCI
      Bridge compatible function together with PCI secondary bus of that bridge.
      For example it can be PCI Express Root port, or Downstream port of PCI
      Express Switch, or PCI Express port of PCI/X to PCI Express (reverse)
      bridge. This node contains also PCI Express link and slot properties for
      downstream direction.
